💡 Project Name: PingRoom (working title)
🧩 Core Idea:
A modern chat app with:

A default general chat room

Temporary, link-based joinable chat rooms (like meeting links)

Once the host ends the room, the chat disappears or is archived

Clean UI/UX for both desktop and mobile

🛠 MVP Feature Set
✅ 1. General Chat Room (Always Available)
Everyone joins here by default

Real-time text messaging via WebSockets

Display usernames, timestamps, message editing/deletion

✅ 2. Temporary "Link-Rooms"
Host clicks “Create Room” → generates a unique invite link (e.g., /join/xyz123)

Others can join via link

Host can:

Set room title

Kick participants

End room → Chat gets closed/archived

✅ 3. Real-Time Messaging
Powered by WebSockets (e.g., using Socket.IO or WebRTC data channels)

Messages sync instantly across all participants

✅ 4. User Identification
Temporary user handles (e.g., Guest#1234)

Option to register/login (basic auth or social login) for saved history and settings

🌟 Innovative / Useful Add-ons (Stretch Goals)
💬 Message Threads

🧠 AI-Powered Smart Summary
